**ABOUT ME** This page is gonna be about all my favorite animes. I love watching animes during my freetime when i'm not doing schoolwork. The first anime that caught my heart is 
**Naruto**. It was the very first anime that i ever watched, so it will always have a placed in my heart. My current favorite anime is **Jujutsu Kaisen**. I just loved everything about it. **Hunter X Hunter** is also a very good anime that people should watch, if they get into anime. I also recommend **Atack on Titan**.
